# Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI

This section covers the basics of Row-Level Security (RLS) in Power BI, including both **Static RLS** and **Dynamic RLS** implementation examples using Power BI Desktop and the Power BI Service.

For the complete walkthrough, including step-by-step instructions, DAX expressions, visuals, and deployment guidance:

## üìÅ Sample File

You can download the example Power BI file for hands-on testing and learning:

‚û°Ô∏è [`pbix/row-level-security-example.pbix`](../pbix/rls-sample-report.pbix)

The file includes:
- Pre-configured static RLS roles
- A dynamic RLS setup using `USERPRINCIPALNAME()`
- Sample tables for employees and regions
- DAX filters for security enforcement

## üß™ Testing with Temporary UPNs

To make testing the dynamic rls simple in Power BI Desktop, the model includes **5 temporary user principal names (UPNs)**. Each UPN is mapped to a different role in the `Employee` table. Use these test users using the **Dynamic RLS** and **"View as Other User"** options in Power BI Desktop:
- TEMP-UPN-1: Asia Sales
- TEMP-UPN-2: United States Sales
- TEMP-UPN-3: Europe Sales
- TEMP-UPN-4: Management
- TEMP-UPN-5: No role assigned

This allows you to preview and validate RLS filtering without needing real email addresses.
